# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Event.create(user_id: 7, location: 'Manhattan', description: 'I had to fire my assistant today, it was either him or I take a pay cut')
#
# Event.create(user_id: 7, location: 'Brooklyn', description: 'I ordered a burito to go but could not finish it. My hands were full and there wasnt a trash can near by. So I threw it on the ground.')
#
#
# Event.create(user_id: 7, location: 'Brooklyn', description: 'I found a stray cat and took it in for the night. In the morning We went to an animal shelter.')
